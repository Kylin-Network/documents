| Documentation                            | Includes the architecture of Kylin Network and the description of how it works | https://github.com/Kylin-Network/documents/blob/main/How-does-Kylin-Network-work-with-Substrate.md                     |
| Testing Guide                            | The instructions of using docker image and how to run this demo can be found in [here](https://github.com/Kylin-Network/documents/blob/main/Kylin-Network-Docker-Demo-Tutorial.md)| https://github.com/Kylin-Network/documents/blob/main/Kylin-Network-Demo-Tutorial.md | 
| Kylin Network Oracle Node Module Repo    | The oracle node, which is also the kylin node. | https://github.com/Kylin-Network/kylin-node                                                                               |
| Kylin Network Data Feeding/Miner Repo    | The data feeding is processed by our ocw related modules. | https://github.com/Kylin-Network/kylin-ocw-module                                                                      |
| Kylin Network Datasource Sample Repo     | The sample datasource repo contains the proxy module which hide the auth related stuffs and provide the data for orcale. The original idea is using Python or NodeJS to implement such a component, but Rust is used at the end. The Python/NodeJS version are still under construction.  | https://github.com/Kylin-Network/sample-data-fetcher         |
| Kylin Network Data Analytics Sample Repo | As we proceed, we change to use elk to collect and analytics data rather than implement a full data analytics solution at the current stage, the advanced data analytics will be planned in the next phases. In this demo, we provide elk together with our docker image with compose file. The default customized dashboard provides as in the final delivery. The ELK stack will perform the analytics based on the data collected from proxy and ocw module. And in the next phase the smart contract call statictis will be added too. | |
| Docker Image                             | In this docker image, all Kylin related staffs are included, such as kylin node, proxy, the scripts to deploy contracts and the elk stack. Download the latest image, and follow the instructions in [here](https://github.com/Kylin-Network/documents/blob/main/Kylin-Network-Demo-Tutorial.md).  Also, this docker image can be built manually according to the building instructions. Here is the instructions to build image [here](https://github.com/Kylin-Network/documents/blob/main/Kylin-Network-Docker-Demo-Tutorial.md) | https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CtuRb16zX36ZafaAZt_CpQIuW8wKsbFG?usp=sharing  |
| Kylin Market Frontend                    | Extra repo which is the key for demonstration. This repo contains the front end for Kylin Market based on Polkadot JS App. With this market frontend, users can find out the oracle data service listed in the oracle market, and can retreive the oracle data through api calls. | https://github.com/Kylin-Network/kylin-market-frontend        |
